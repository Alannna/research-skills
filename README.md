## Event description:

[Local community leader] is hosting a Researcher Skills workshop sponsored by the ResearchOps Community. We're bringing together small-to-medium sized groups of researchers to discuss specific challenges in doing the work, reflect on past project experience, and evaluate skills and career progression with new tools developed by the community. 

It's also an opportunity to help us give back. Organizers will collect some of our workshop output and send it back to the ResearchOps community. We'll clean up and open-source all of the researcher skills data, and gatehr a project team together to publish a well-informed skills framework that researchers everywhere can use as a guide for growth and career progression.

### Participant expectations:

Show up a few minutes early to get settled in. The workshop is hands-on, with a mix of discussion, activities, and personal worksheets. The workshop itself will last 2 to 2.5 hours, and you'll be joining a mix of in-house researchers, consulting researchers, and designers who do research as you go.

Bring a pen & pencil, and your favorite colored markers if you like. Your organizer will provide scratch paper for the activities, and printed worksheets for the more structured exercises.
